<p> New features for 2017
Once again the 2017 GT-R raises the bar for ultimate performance. Inside, the GT-R takes a giant step forward with a new design that reduces driver workload, while stepping up to a new level of premium with hand-selected and handcrafted materials. Add in greater power, and a suspension retuned to provide a more supple ride while enhancing handling, and Legendary Exhilaration has never looked better.

<p id="special"> From start to finish, each GT-R engine is handcrafted by its own master engine-builder in a climate-controlled "clean room." Each twin-turbo V6 is precisely assembled from lightweight, highly durable aluminum and magnesium parts. It takes the exacting standards of the planet's most talented and devoted engine builders to produce the engine that has redefined what a supercar can be.
